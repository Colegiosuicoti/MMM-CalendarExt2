## VIEW
- **View** is a specific look and definition to display events. Each view could have several calendars which is defined in `calendars` section. And each view instance can be reusable in multi-scenes.
- There are several view mode; `upcoming`, `current`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `week`, `month`. 
- `views:[]` should have at least one or more `view` as its items.

```
views: [
  {
    name: "Upcoming Hotspurs",
    mode: "upcoming",
    position: "top_right",
    calendars: ["Hotspurs calendar"],
  },
  {
    name: "My family affairs",
    mode: "month",
    position: "bottom_bar",
    calendars: ["holidays", "ScheduleOfWife", "KID SCHOOL PLAN"],
  },
],
```
This example shows 2 views. 
- **Upcoming Hotspurs** is `upcoming` view and will be displayed in `top_right` with "Hotspurs calendar".
- **My family affairs** is `month` view and will be displayed in `bottom_bar` with 3 calendars. (calendars should be already defined in [calendars section][2b. Configuration:Calendar] of configuration)

Your Scene could have these as its views.
