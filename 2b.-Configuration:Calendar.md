# Calendar

## Example
```javascript
calendars : [
  {
    name: "US holiday",
    icon: "noto-beach-with-umbrella",
    className: "holiday",
    url: "http://www.calendarlabs.com/templates/ical/US-Holidays.ics",
  },
  {
    name : "Tottenham",
    icon: "noto-soccer-ball",
    replaceTitle:[
      ["Tottenham Hotspur", ""],
      [" - ", ""]
    ],
    className: "Tottenham",
    url: "https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/ovb564thnod82u5c4njut98728%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics",
  },
],
```
`calendars:[]` could have at least ONE (and more) calendar to get events. Each calendar should have `url`. If you want to use local `.ics` file, put into MM directory and can contact it with `"https://localhost:8080/YOUR.ics"`. 

## Default values of calendar
Below fields are predefined values. Unless overriding it, this will be used by default.
```
{
  url: "",
  name: "",
  maxItems: 100,
  scanInterval: 1000*60*30,
  beforeDays: 60,
  afterDays: 365,
  maxIterations: 100,
  forceLocalTZ: false,
  replaceTitle:[],
  icon: "",
  className: "",
  filter: (event)=>{return true}
}
```
- **url** : **REQUIRED** URL of `.ics`
- **name** : **OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED** name of this calendar. This value will be used in `view` to pick up specific calendar.
- **maxItems** : how much events should be parsed.
- **scanInterval** : (milliseconds) how often calendar should be rescanned.
- **beforeDays**, **afterDays** : Events between these days will be got.
