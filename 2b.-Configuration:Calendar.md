# Calendar

## Example
```javascript
calendars : [
  {
    name: "US holiday",
    icon: "noto-beach-with-umbrella",
    className: "holiday",
    url: "http://www.calendarlabs.com/templates/ical/US-Holidays.ics",
  },
  {
    name : "Tottenham",
    icon: "noto-soccer-ball",
    replaceTitle:[
      ["Tottenham Hotspur", ""],
      [" - ", ""]
    ],
    className: "Tottenham",
    url: "https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/ovb564thnod82u5c4njut98728%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics",
  },
],
```
`calendars:[]` could have at least ONE (and more) calendar to get events. Each calendar should have `url`. If you want to use local `.ics` file, put into MM directory and can contact it with `"https://localhost:8080/YOUR.ics"`. 

## Default values of calendar
Below fields are predefined values. Unless overriding it, this will be used by default.
```javascript
{
  url: "",
  name: "",
  maxItems: 100,
  scanInterval: 1000*60*30,
  beforeDays: 60,
  afterDays: 365,
  maxIterations: 100,
  forceLocalTZ: false,
  replaceTitle:[],
  icon: "",
  className: "",
  filter: (event)=>{return true}
}
```
- **url** : **REQUIRED** URL of `.ics`
- **name** : **OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED** name of this calendar. This value will be used in `view` to pick up specific calendar.
- **maxItems** : how much events should be parsed.
- **scanInterval** : (milliseconds) how often calendar should be rescanned.
- **beforeDays**, **afterDays** : Events between these days will be got.
- **maxIterations**: If event is recurrent type, how many recurrence will be parsed.
- **forceLocalTZ** : Some iCal has wrong time zone information. When the iCal has that kind of problem, this option could be a simple fix.
- **replaceTitle** : Array of [`pattern`, `replace`].
  - e.g) 
```js
replaceTitle:[
  ["Tottenham Hotspurs", "SPURS"],
  [" - ", " vs "]
],
```
  - With this configuration, event title `"Totten Hotspurs - FC. Arsenal"` will be changed to `"SPURS vs FC. Arsenal"`.

  - `pattern` could be the RegExp and `replace` could be result of RegExp. In below example, event title `"Thanks God Its Friday"` will be replaced as `"TGIF"`
```js
replaceTitle:[
  ["/([A-Z])([a-z]+ ?)/g", "$1"]
],
```
