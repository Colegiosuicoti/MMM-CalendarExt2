## What's different with `MMM-CalendarExt`
But if you have no dissatisfaction with `MMM-CalendarExt`, leave it.
- New parser. New look.
- `profile` is deprecated. `scene` is more than that.
- Beautiful timeline view (month/week)
- dynamic scene changeable.

## Updates

- FIXED: calendar filter is implemented (Sorry, I've totally forgotten it).

**[1.0.2]**

**[1.0.1]**
- `view:transform()` is added, now you can modify event value as your wish.


## MEMO
### Bug with MMM-Carousel.
- When you are using it with `MMM-Carousel`, `MMM-CalendarExt2` should be in main page or all pages.
