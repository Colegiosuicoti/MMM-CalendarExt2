## What's different with `MMM-CalendarExt`
But if you have no dissatisfaction with `MMM-CalendarExt`, leave it.
- New parser. New look.
- `profile` is deprecated. `scene` is more than that.
- Beautiful timeline view (month/week)
- dynamic scene changeable.

## MEMO
- I should release this before my winter holidays. So this is not tested fully. I cannot answer or patch during the season.
- Bug reports, PR, any other suggestions are always welcome!
